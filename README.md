# üòé Alessio Tucci

**` aspiring Developer (Developer, Communication major, Creator)`**

Alright, alright, So here's the deal. I've got some experience in communication and basic work under my belt, plus I did some study abroad in the US and Lithuania. I even started a Computer Science program where I'm learning C and the basics of coding. And when I'm not doing that, I like to mess around with photos, vlogging, and even TikTok. Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
I publish content on my YouTube channel "[AlessioTucci][youtube]" to more than 4 subscribers.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey (if you care) </h3></summary>
 Oh boy, let me tell you about my education history.
 
  Well, it looks like I will not graduate on time. I'm currently studing communication at La Sapienza university of Rome. 

In all seriousness though, life happens and things don't always go as planned. I may be a little behind schedule, but I'm still working hard to finish my degree and move on to the next chapter of my life. Better late than never, right?
  
  I have studied Communication and Media Studies at Vilnius University, where I spent a semester as part of the Erasmus+ Programme. Yeah, Lithuania, not exactly the hottest spot for studying abroad, but hey, at least it was something different, right? And I even got a scholarship from the European Union, so I guess it wasn't all bad.

Before that, I spent five years in a scientific high school, Liceo Statale Ettore Majorana. You would think spending all that time in a science-focused environment would have made me some kind of engineering genius, but nope, here I am.

And let's not forget my time in Nashville High School, where I spent my junior year and played basketball and soccer. I was pretty decent at basketball, but only made the junior varsity team, which is basically just a participation trophy. Soccer, on the other hand, let's just say it wasn't my forte.

Oh, and I took the ACT, but my score was just average, so no Ivy League schools for me. But who needs an Ivy League education when you are me, right?
  
Let's take a look at my own work history now. Delivery driver, food server, crew member at KFC, and sushi restaurant waiter. I'm quite the go-getter in the food industry, aren't I? I could regale you with tales of the glamorous life of working in fast food and delivering food around Rome, but I'll spare you.

I mean, who in their right mind would want to spend their life schlepping food around and serving customers all day? Not me, that's for sure. And don't get me started on the joys of deep cleaning fryers and watering plants. It's a real thrill, let me tell you.

But in all seriousness, I have to give credit where credit is due. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to stick with those kinds of low-paying jobs, especially when working in a foreign country. I guess you could say I have a diverse range of experience in the food industry. And hey, maybe I can use that experience to my advantage in the future. Who knows?
